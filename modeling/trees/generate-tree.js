/*
Generate a tree.
This is the main script, it does three things:

1. generate random points in a shape where the tree should have its crown (using shapes.js)
2. grow a gree into that shape (using tree-generator.js)
3. output the tree into stdout

Additionally, a bit of statistics is output into stderr.
