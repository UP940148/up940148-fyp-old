Create a camera object
Create a camera helper (?)
Make camera object move on sine wave around point (0, 0, 0)
Add toggle for orbital cam versus flight cam
Figure out way to define flight path (Maybe MatLab can help)
    - A-Level maths, don't fail me now
Lighting?
    - Panels projecting light?
    - Panel that follows the camera and projects light
        - Would make pre-rendering near impossible as light couldn't be calculated in advance, would depend on camera position at the time
    - Static panels projecting light, but have the camera reset position upon pressing play
        - Setting the camera to match the current time is proving moderately tricky
